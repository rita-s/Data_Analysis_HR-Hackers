# Job Market Data Analysis

### Summary

###### According to Jobscan, 99% of Fortune 500 companies use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) as their recruitment strategy.
###### All ATS' store candidates' information by using keywords, so it's easy to parse and filter them.
###### If applicant's resume does not meet certain criteria, it is either flagged or auto-rejected.
###### "Beat the ATS" Project aims to analyse the most popular tools and skills (keywords) for Data Analytics field and check if there is a relationship between those skills and earnings.


### Research Questions:
<b>All research questions are based on years 2020-2021 in the United States of America</b>


###### 1. What were the most popular technologies employers sought in Data Analytics field in the period 2020-2021? (Frequency analysis)
###### 2. What were the most popular tools employers sought? (Frequency analysis)
###### 3. What were the most popular soft skills? (Frequency analysis)
###### 4. Is there a relationship between education level and earnings? If yes, what is the relationship? (Regression analysis)
###### 5. Is there a relationship between years of experience and earnings? If yes, what is the relationship? (Regression analysis)


### Hypotheses:
###### 1. There are certain technologies that are more sought after than others.
###### 2. There are certain tools that are more sought after than others.
###### 3. There are certain soft skills that are sought after by employers.
###### 4. There is a correlation between education level and earnings.
###### 5. There is a correlation between experience level (measured in years) and earnings.


### Findings:
###### 1. The analysis has confirmed all five hypotheses.
###### 2. There are certain technologies that are more sought after than others: the most sought after language for Data Analytics is SQL, the second is Python, the third is SAS.
###### 3. There are certain tools that are more sought after than others: the most sought after tool is Tableau and then Power BI.
###### 4. There are certain soft skills that are sought after by employers: the most sought after soft skill is Communication and ability rot work in agile as well as problem-solving skills (in this order).

###### 8. There is a correlation between experience level (measured in years) and earnings: as years of experience increase, the annual salary increases proportionally.
